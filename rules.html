    <p>While there were many, many notable Assyrian Kings through the ages, we will begin with These Kings. Three of four Kings will be loaded as possible answers to the set of five historical trivia questions that load. Select the King you believe is the correct answer to each question. Each King has five accompanying questions, so the more you play, the more you will learn more about which King is which.</p>

    <p>If you are correct, you will earn a point. You will only win with a perfect five out of five possible points. Thankfully, you may retry as many times as you wish, but you will most likely recieve a different set of questions and Kings.</p>
