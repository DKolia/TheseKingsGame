    <p>My name is David Kolia and I am a full-stack developer, photographer, and am an Assyrian myself. My parents immigrated to the US in the late 70s due to political and religious persecution that was common against minorities in that time and place. Having grown up in the United States during the 90s, I was immersed in American culture, but I never forgot my heritage. I speak Assyrian, brew tea like my parents did back home, and enjoy learning and sharing more about my people and history.</p>

    <p>In building this game I hope to not only test people's historical prowess, but also raise awareness of who the Assyrians are, where they currently live, and what struggles these often forgotten people have to live through.</p>
